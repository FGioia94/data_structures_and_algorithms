# Intro to Data Structures

💡In Python, dictionaries are data structures

- **Data:** Value, simple measurement of something
- **Data Structure:** A specialized format for organizing, processing, and storing data
- **Information:** Result of the elaboration of data. We use algorithms to transform data to information

- **Queue:** First in first out (FIFO)
- **Stack:** Last in first out (LIFO)

- **Arrays:** Static structures
- **Lists:** Dynamic structures, objects can be moved
- **Stacks/Piles:** there is a pre defined order of movement

An algorithm to be called so needs to have:
1. A finite amount of steps
2. Needs to terminate/exit its calculation
3. Needs to be deterministic, each step needs to have defined steps
4. Needs to have a input set of data and output a set of data

- **Trees:** They are a particular type of **graph** used to define hierarchical structures
